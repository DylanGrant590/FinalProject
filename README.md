🏦 Jamaica Bank of the West Indies – Java Console Banking System
A simple, interactive Java console application simulating core banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and managing interest. Developed for learning, testing, or expanding into a more advanced system.

📌 Overview
This application provides a menu-driven experience where users can:

Open or access accounts

Deposit and withdraw funds

View account balances

Apply interest rates

View total assets across all accounts

Edit or delete accounts

The program is built with a modular structure using three main classes:

Teller: Handles the UI and user navigation

Bank: Manages a list of accounts and related operations

BankAccount: Represents individual bank accounts and handles transactions

⚠️ Known Issues & Bugs
Interest listener methods (addInterestListener, removeInterestListener) may recurse or misfire due to confusion between Bank and CaretListener logic.

CaretListener interface is not required; UI references (e.g., CaretEvent) can be removed.

Some try-catch blocks catch exceptions that never occur in those contexts.

getTotalAssets() logic is flawed and doesn’t calculate actual total across accounts.

Account identification is based only on name, which may not be unique.

🛠 Suggested Improvements
Replace account name with unique account ID (e.g., UUID)

Add persistent storage (file or database)

Clean up unused methods and redundant code

Implement unit tests with JUnit

Refactor to remove unused Swing/CaretListener components

Use BigDecimal for accurate financial calculations

📚 Technologies Used
Java Standard Edition (JDK 8+)

Java Collections (ArrayList, Iterator)
